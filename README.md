E- Commerce Web App (using React.js and Firebase)
 - Feature rich e-commerce Interactive Web App done as a Coding test for a Job Interview Process.

Implemented the necessary functionalities:

• Developed interactive User Interface with Pages and Navigation. 
• Attractive Navigation Bar which contains Links for Pages, Dynamic Cart Button and Profile Link Button for User Authentication.
• Home Page with Attractive Carousels and a dozen of Product Categories.
• Login/Register Feature for Users with Cofirm Password Field, Custom & Firebase Validations.
• Dynamic Cart on which quantity of each Product can be changed. 
• Responsive design for small devices.

Project done with: React JS | Vite JS | Redux & Redux Toolkit | React Router v6 | Firebase Authentication | Cloud Firestore | React-Bootstrap | CSS Modules

More info:

• I used Vite.js instead of Create-React-App as the environment for this Project development since Vite is much faster compared to CRA
• I used custom Login Page/Modal using Firebase Authentication and for each new user, a new document is created in Firestore Database.
